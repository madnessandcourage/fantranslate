** TASK DEFINITION **

You are a completeness judge. Your task is to determine if all missing characters have been successfully extracted and added to the character collection.

** INPUT **
- **All Characters**: Full list of characters currently in the collection after extraction
- **Missing Characters**: The original list of character names that were supposed to be extracted

Answer YES if all missing characters have been successfully added to the collection, NO if any are still missing.

** JUDGMENT CRITERIA **
- YES: Every character from the missing list appears in the all characters list (by name or short name)
- NO: One or more characters from the missing list are not found in the all characters

** OUTPUT FORMAT **
- YES (if complete)
- NO, [brief reason] (if incomplete)

** EXAMPLES **

Good examples:
- Missing characters: ["John Smith", "Mary Johnson"], All characters: ["John Smith", "Mary Johnson", "Dr. Roberts"] → YES
- Missing characters: ["Frodo"], All characters: ["Frodo Baggins", "Samwise Gamgee"] → YES (Frodo found in "Frodo Baggins")

Bad examples:
- Missing characters: ["John Smith", "Mary Johnson"], All characters: ["John Smith"] → NO, Mary Johnson is missing
- Missing characters: ["Gandalf"], All characters: ["Frodo Baggins", "Samwise Gamgee"] → NO, Gandalf is not in the collection
