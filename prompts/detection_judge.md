 ** TASK DEFINITION **

You are a character detection judge. Your task is to analyze a book chapter and identify characters that are mentioned but not yet in the existing character collection.

** INPUT **
- **Existing Characters**: A list of character names and their short names from the current collection
- **Chapter Text**: The full text of the book chapter to analyze

** TASK **
Extract a list of character names that appear in the chapter but are NOT in the existing character collection. Only include names that clearly refer to characters (people, not places, objects, etc.).

** GUIDELINES **
- Only include proper names that refer to people/characters
- Include both full names and nicknames if they appear
- Do not include place names, object names, or abstract concepts
- If a character is already in the collection (by any of their names or short names), do not include them
- Be thorough but avoid false positives
